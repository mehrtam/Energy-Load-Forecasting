# **Energy Load Forecasting Using AI**

## **🔹 Project Overview**
This project focuses on forecasting energy consumption using machine learning techniques. The model utilizes historical real-world power consumption data from **Iran’s National Power Grid** (from **March 22, 2019 – February 9, 2023**) with hourly temperature records. The goal is to develop an accurate forecasting model and compare predictions with actual consumption data for the final 40 days of 2022.

## **📌 Features**
- ✅ **Processed 34,000 hourly-labeled samples** of real-world energy consumption data.
- ✅ **Engineered features**, ensuring a minimum of **20 derived features (including up to the 20th-order differentials)** for improved forecasting.
- ✅ **Designed & trained ML models**, using **20-30% of the dataset** for training to enhance model generalization.
- ✅ **Developed a time-series forecasting model** to predict **energy demand for the last 40 days of 2022 (24×40 hourly predictions).**
- ✅ **Evaluated model performance** by comparing forecasted vs. actual energy consumption values.
